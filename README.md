# Time-Series-Forecast-US-Unemployment
Short-term and long-term forecast of US unemployment using time series models

The unemployment rate of a country is an indirect indicator of the health of the economy. Historically, the unemployment rates in the US have skyrocketed in times of economic crises, as businesses, both big and small, have been unable to support their employees. The graph below shows the monthly unemployment rate in the US starting from January 1948 to December 2020.

From the graph, we see that the unemployment rates seem to have a periodic component. The objective of this project is to determine whether the unemployment rates in the US can be forecasted for the next 12 months based on the patterns in historical data. If it is possible to make accurate forecasts based on leading indicators, countries and businesses can take preventive measures to mitigate or minimize the effects of the forthcoming economic crisis.

Due to COVID-19, the world economy has suffered a shock in 2020, leading to rising unemployment rates. By forecasting the unemployment rates based on historical data and comparing it to the actual measurements from 2020, we will be able to derive a tangible measure of the effect COVID-19 has had on the economy of the USA.
